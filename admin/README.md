## Getting Started

Start by setting up the environment variables in the `.env` file.
You should have a MongoDB instance running locally or remotely.

```bash
export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/webcrumbs" # replace with your MongoDB connection string
```
    
Then, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
