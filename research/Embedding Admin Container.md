# Exploration of a Modular Web Architecture: Embedding Admin Container

## Introduction

In the heart of modern web development lies the quest for modular and maintainable architectures. Our venture explores a framework where plugins, created using diverse JavaScript frameworks and bundled through Webpack, are managed by an Admin container. This Admin container is constructed with Next.js, known for its robust Server Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities. The goal is to have a setup where the Admin container can be effortlessly integrated into any website through a simple script tag, thereby extending the website's functionality in a modular fashion.

## Goal Outline

1. **Modular Plugin Design**:
   - Create individual plugins using various JavaScript frameworks.
   - Bundle these plugins using Webpack to ensure a standardized and optimized output.

2. **Admin Container Creation**:
   - Develop an Admin container using Next.js to manage these plugins.
   - Implement lazy loading to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

3. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:
   - Utilize the SSR capabilities of Next.js to render the plugins server-side, ensuring a SEO-friendly and performant user experience.

4. **Routing Management**:
   - Administer control over specific routes and pages through the Admin container, allowing for a structured and organized user interface.

5. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Design the setup in a way that the Admin container can be easily integrated into any website via a simple script tag.

## Technical Findings

### Webpack Bundling:

Webpack proves to be a reliable tool for bundling the plugins and the Admin container. It not only bundles the assets but also optimizes them for performance. The bundling process is crucial to ensure that the plugins and the Admin container are delivered efficiently to the client.

Webpack is our chosen tool for bundling the plugins and the Admin container. Here's a basic example of a Webpack config file for bundling a plugin:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'plugin.bundle.js',
    path: __dirname + '/dist'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        use: 'babel-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Lazy Loading & SSR:

Next.js provides a solid ground for implementing lazy loading through its dynamic import functionality. This feature is crucial for loading plugins on-demand, ensuring resources are utilized optimally. On the other hand, SSR is a core feature of Next.js that allows for the server-side rendering of the plugins, ensuring that the content is SEO-friendly and the initial page load is fast.

Next.js facilitates lazy loading through its dynamic import functionality, and SSR through its dedicated API routes and server functions. Here's a simplified example:

```javascript
// pages/_app.js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const LazyLoadedPlugin = dynamic(() => import('../components/Plugin'), {
  ssr: true
});

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <LazyLoadedPlugin />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

### Routing Control:

The powerful routing mechanism of Next.js can be tailored to accommodate control over specific routes and pages through the Admin container. This control is crucial for maintaining a coherent and organized user interface, ensuring that the user experience remains intuitive and engaging.

Routing control can be administered through the file-based routing mechanism provided by Next.js. Below is a simplistic example:

```javascript
// pages/admin.js
import AdminContainer from '../components/AdminContainer';

function AdminPage() {
  return <AdminContainer />;
}

export default AdminPage;
```

### Conditional Dynamic Routing:

The process of implementing conditional dynamic routing in Next.js involves several steps. First, you fetch the list of strings (which represent route parameters) from an API using data fetching functions like getStaticPaths. These strings are then used to create pages with dynamic routes, where the getStaticProps function fetches the necessary data for each page based on the route parameter. To handle invalid routes, you can set the fallback option to false in getStaticPaths to render a 404 page for routes that don't match any string in your list. This setup ensures pages are created only for routes that match the specified conditions, offering a clean and efficient approach to managing conditional dynamic routing in Next.js.

```javascript
// pages/posts/[slug].js

// Fetch available routes from an external API
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/strings');  // Replace with your API
  const strings = await res.json();

  // Create paths with the fetched strings
  const paths = strings.map(string => ({
    params: { slug: string },
  }));

  // Define static paths and fallback behavior
  return { paths, fallback: false };  // fallback set to false to show a 404 for unknown routes
}

// Fetch data based on the route parameter
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`);  // Replace with your API
  const post = await res.json();

  return { props: { post } };
}

// Render the page with the fetched data
function Post({ post }) {
  return <div>{post.title}</div>;
}

export default Post;
```

### Script Tag Integration:

The integration of the Admin container into other websites via a script tag encompasses several steps. Firstly, a loader script needs to be crafted which will asynchronously load the main Webpack bundle of the Admin container. This loader script is what will be embedded in other websites. Secondly, once the main bundle is loaded, the Admin container needs to be initialized, and the necessary routes and pages need to be set up. This setup is crucial to ensure that the integration is seamless and the functionality extended by the Admin container operates flawlessly.

Embedding the Admin container into other websites can be achieved through a loader script. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```javascript
// loader.js
(function() {
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://yourdomain.com/admin.bundle.js';  // URL of your Webpack bundle
  script.async = true;
  document.head.appendChild(script);
})();
```

## Challenges & Considerations

### Cross-Origin Restrictions:

Given that the Admin container will be loaded from a different origin, cross-origin restrictions are a potential challenge. Proper configuration of CORS headers is essential to allow the scripts to be loaded and executed on other domains.

### Error Handling:

Robust error handling is crucial to ensure that any issues within the Admin container do not affect the host website. Implementing a solid error handling strategy will ensure that the user experience remains unaffected in case of any errors or issues.

### Performance Optimization:

Performance optimization is key to ensure that the integration of the Admin container does not adversely affect the performance of the host website. Techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and optimization of static assets are crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience.
