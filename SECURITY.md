## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We request that you **do not publicize the vulnerability before giving us a chance to address it**.

### How to Report

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to [community@webcrumbs.org](mailto:community@webcrumbs.org). The email should include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps for reproducing the vulnerability, if applicable
- Your name (optional), or anonymous if you prefer

### What to Expect

Once you submit your report, you can expect:

1. An acknowledgment of receipt of your vulnerability report (within 24-48 hours).
2. Assessment and validation of the issue (within one week).
3. Timely updates on the status and resolution of the issue.
4. Credit for discovering the issue, unless you wish to remain anonymous.

We take all security reports seriously, and we appreciate your responsible disclosure. Thank you for helping us ensure the security and privacy of our users.
